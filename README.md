# External-Merge-Sort

External Sorting is a class of algorithms used to deal with massive amounts of data that do not fit in memory. 

Aim: Implementing K-Way merge sort algorithm to sort a very large array. 
This algorithm is a perfect example of
the use of divide and conquer where with limited resources large problems are tackled by breaking the problem space 
into small computable subspaces and then operations are done on them.

Input: A file containing a large unsorted list of integers (Will not fit in usual Laptop RAM).

Output : A file containing non-Descending sorted list of the given integers.
